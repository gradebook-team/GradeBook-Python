            <p>The GradeBook team has been working hard (and sacrificing a dangerous amount of time despite finals) to bring you some spicy updates.</p>
            <p>Class name now appears as the title of class pages.</p>

            <p>Grade table width was expanded to be symmetrical on both sides.</p>

            <p>If you didn't already notice, GradeBook now supports HTTPS, so please use that if you want your private information safe.</p>
            <p>The stupid login screen now logs you in when you press the "enter" key. You no longer have to actually click on the "login" button :DDDDD</p>

            <p>You are also able to adjust grades. This feature is still a little bit sketchy, since it's a major change. The goal of this feature is to help students figure out how their grade would change, for example, if a certain assignment was graded differently, or if their next timed writed was scored a 87%. To use it, click on the green menu button on the bottom right corner when you're inside a class. This will allow you to see your speculative grade as you change things. In the menu, you can also add assignments, reset assignments, as well as scroll to the top to see your graph.</p>
            <p>To actually change the grade of an assignment, simply click on the point numbers, and you'll be able to type new ones in. Adjusted grades are bolded and colored blue. To change the assignment type, click on the assignment type, and you'll see a drop down menu allowing you to choose what type it is.</p>
